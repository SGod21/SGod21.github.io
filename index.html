                <h2>Topic 1: Theories</h2>
                <p>
                    Humans are naturally social creatures. Our urge for connection can be seen in the ties we create with carers, family members, and peers as early as infancy. Relationships are the foundation of our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. They provide us a sense of belonging, support, and purpose. The importance of meaningful interactions has never been greater in a world that is increasingly interconnected yet paradoxically secluded.
                    Relationships define our identities, impact our behaviors, and contribute to our general health, whether through the warmth of a close friendship, the intimacy of a love partnership, or the advice of a mentor. Research in psychology regularly reveals that strong social ties are associated with better enjoyment, lower stress, and even longer life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Contemporary young people's life activities and subjective judgements imply that the shift to adult roles has grown delayed and protracted, spawning a new transitional period spanning from the late teens to the mid- to late-twenties, called emerging adulthood. 
                    </p>
                    <p>During this transitory stage, individuals are going through a crucial period of gaining a sense of independence and developing their adult roles and identities. As such, the kind of relationships they form also change. Friendships acquire more depth to them, there are changing family dynamics as the individuals leave home in pursuit of autonomy and exploration of self and career, and engagement in romantic and intimate relationships begin. Researchers are increasingly viewing emerging adulthood as a unique developmental stage in which the brain is still evolving and altering its neural networks. It is usually a period of uncertainty and self-discovery in which the emerging adult is still finding out the world and his or her position in it (Arnett, 2010, de Dios, 2012; Sumner, Burrow, & Hill, 2015).

                <h3>Arnett's Theory of Emerging Adulthood and its Implications on Relationships</h3>
                <p>
                    Jeffery Jensen Arnett is the developmental psychologist who coined the term ‘Emerging Adulthood’. According to him, this is a distinct life period from 18 to 25.

                <h3>Erikson's Psychosocial Stage of Intimacy vs Isolation</h3>
                    <p>
                        According to Erik Erikson's psychosocial development theory, the sixth stage, i.e., Intimacy vs. Isolation, occurs in early adulthood, usually between the ages of 18 and 40.

                    <h3>Attachment Theory</h3>
                    <p>
                        This theory, which was first put forth by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, investigates the ways in which attachment patterns in later relationships are influenced by early ties with caregivers. When individuals enter into romantic and platonic relationships, emerging adults frequently go back to and modify these attachment patterns. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>John Bowlby</b>
                    </p>
                    <p><i>Origins</i></p>
                    <p>Bowlby's thesis is based on ethology, the study of animal behavior, and emphasizes that attachment behaviors are biologically hardwired for survival. Infants are born with intrinsic behaviors (crying, clinging, smiling) that motivate adults to care for them.
                        Bowlby advocated that a primary caregiver (often the mother) establish a "secure base" for the kid, allowing them to explore their surroundings while remaining safe. This solid bond promotes positive emotional and social development.
                        </p>
                        <p>Phases of Attachment Development</p>
                        <p>Bowlby identified four phases of attachment:</p>
                        <p>Pre-attachment (0-2 months): Infants show inherent signals (like crying) that attract carers but do not form strong attachments.</p>
                        <p>Attachment-in-the-making (2-6 months): Infants begin to express preferences for familiar carers and develop a sense of trust.</p>
                        <p>Clear-cut attachment (6 months to 2 years): A strong emotional relationship forms, causing separation anxiety while the carer is absent. Children eagerly seek proximity with their attachment figure.</p>
                        <p>Formation of reciprocal relationships (2 years and older): As children mature, they begin to grasp carer availability and create more reciprocal ties, allowing for greater independence.</p>
                    
                    <p> Mary Ainsworth</p>    <p>
                        Mary Ainsworth created the "Strange Situation," an observational research that evaluates the level of attachment between newborns and caregivers. This planned approach consists of a sequence of separations and reunions with the caregiver, allowing researchers to examine infant responses to stress.
                    <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_6rQk7jlrc" target="_blank">Strange Situation!</a>
                    <p> Attachment Styles </p>
                    <p>Ainsworth identified three basic attachment patterns based on the infants' behavior during the Strange Situation:</p>
                    <p>Secure Attachment: This style is displayed by 60-70% of newborns. They are distressed when the carer departs but comforted when they return. These children feel safe exploring their surroundings, showing a close relationship with their caregiver.</p>
                    <p>Dismissive-Avoidant Attachment: This type is exhibited by approximately 15-20% of newborns. They exhibit minimal distress when the carer departs and avoid or ignore them when they return. This might be seen as a caregiver's unresponsive or rejecting behavior, which causes the child to develop self-reliance and emotional detachment.</p>
                    <p>Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment: This category applies to approximately 10-15% of babies. When the carer leaves, they get quite worried and are difficult to soothe upon their return. This demonstrates inconsistent caring, causing anxiety and clinginess in the youngster.</p>
                    <p>Ainsworth later found a fourth kind, Disorganized Attachment, established by Mary Main and Judith Solomon, which is distinguished by a lack of identified attachment behavior and is frequently seen in children who have experienced trauma or bereavement.</p>
                    <p>Implications on Relationships</p>
                    <p>Individuals with a secure attachment style tend to have positive self-esteem and attitudes towards others. They are at ease with both intimacy and independence, and they strike an appropriate balance between the two. Securely bonded adults have better, more satisfying relationships. They are more likely to communicate well, trust their partners, and offer and seek support when necessary. They handle problems constructively and maintain a strong emotional connection and stability with their spouses.
                        </p>
                        <p>Individuals with anxious-preoccupied attachment type tend to have a negative self-image but a positive perspective of others. They may seek connection and approval, but they can also become overly reliant on their partners for validation. These persons may experience extreme emotional highs and lows of their relationships. They frequently fear desertion and may be extremely sensitive to perceived rejection or lack of interest. This can cause clinginess, jealousy, and conflict, making it difficult to maintain long-term relationship stability.
                        </p>
                        <p>Adults with avoidant-dismissive attachment style tend to have a positive self-image but a poor impression of others. They respect independence and tend to shun closeness or emotional intimacy. They may struggle to create strong emotional relationships, keeping partners at a distance to retain their sense of autonomy. They frequently avoid relying on people and may come out as emotionally distant or disdainful. Conflicts can emerge when partners demand greater intimacy than they are comfortable with.</p>
                        <p>Individuals with fearful-avoidant (disorganized) attachment type are unpredictable, alternating between desiring closeness and avoiding intimacy due to fear. Individuals frequently have a negative perspective of themselves and others as a result of a lack of consistent connection experiences during their childhood. Fearful-avoidant people can have problematic relationships. They may want intimacy but also dread it, resulting in a push-pull tendency in relationships. This inconsistency can lead to chaotic and unstable relationships, characterized by high levels of anxiety, emotional turbulence, and conflict.</p>
                        </p>
                        <p>In summary, relationships during the period are shaped by various developmental factors. Arnett’s theory places emphasis on identity exploration during this time, wherein young adults seek out meaning and independence. This in turn impacts their approach to their relationships. Erikson underscores the importance of building close and meaningful bonds, whereas attachment theory highlights how our early childhood experiences with caregivers influences the intimacy and trust we establish in our relationships. All of these perspectives reveal to us that relationships that are formed during emerging adulthood are central to personal growth and are important in shaping long-term emotional wellbeing and identity.</p>

                    <h2>Topic 2: Romantic and Platonic Relationships</h2>
                    <p>The APA defines love as a "Complex Emotion" that includes a depth of "tenderness and affection" for the object of this emotion. This is true for all kinds of love we experience, whether familial, romantic or platonic.  Humans, as the social creatures that we are, crave to make meaningful connections and bonds with our fellow beings. Our need for love and belongingness even features on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as ‘Love needs’, where he states that it is one of the primary needs that can help an individual attain the ultimate goal, i.e, Self-Actualization. This means to become the peak or the best version of themselves possible. Relationships are the backbone of society, of community and of life. As opposed to popular belief there are many different kinds of relationships, just as there are many different kinds of love. In this topic, we will look at everything from the basic evolutionary theories of relationships to types of relationships to understanding how people become attracted to one another.</p>
                    <h3>Evolutionary Perspectives on the Formation of Relationships</h3>
                    <p>
                        Through the long process of evolution that took us from primate to present man, there have been certain innate and instinctive behaviors that have allowed us to survive and evolve into what we have become today. These theories explain how and why relationships have been formed and have implications to the present day.

                    <h3>Romantic Relationships</h3>
                    <p>Romantic relationship can be understood as an ingoing, voluntary and mutual interaction between two people, characterized by certain expressions of affection and intimacy (Collins, et al., 2009). These are relationships that are based on physical attraction and emotional connection, potentially developing into a long-term intimate partnership.</p>

                    </p>
                    <h3>Friendships</h3>
                    <p>Friendships can be understood as close bonds, long-lasting relationships between two or more people. These bonds include mutual care, trust, and support. Most friendships are formed due to shared interests and experiences. Our best representations of friendships come from various movies, like Star Trek (Captain Kirk and Spock), and Toy Story (Woody and Buzz Lightyear). According to Dr. Suzzanne Degges-White, a psychologist and friendship expert from Northern Illinois University, friendships are relationships that have two critical dimensions of interdependence and voluntary participation. </p>
                    <p>The different kinds of friendships are acquaintance, friend, close friend and best friend.</p>

                    <p><a href="">Discussion!</a></p>
                    <p>Studies have shown that the quality of friendships undergo changes during emerging adulthood. Women report high levels of intimacy and companionship and less conflict than men in early emerging adulthood (Barry et al., 2013; Langheit, S. & Poulin, F., 2022). However, this intimacy starts to decline subtly during the 20s and then markedly. In contrast, in men their intimacy with their best friend stays relatively stable. Reasons that have been offered for this is that women may have a lack of time, and due to the increasing adult responsibilities, it becomes hard to have intimate exchanges with their best friend. For men, it has been said that they reach their peak friendship quality during their early 20s. (Langheit, S. & Poulin, F., 2022). </p>
                    <p>Same-sex Friendships:</p>
                    <p>Men tend to seek out friendships that are more activity-based, meaning that their friendships are built around participating in shared activities and experiences and are casual in nature, whereas women tend to seek out more “friendships relationships”, wherein the friendship is a lot more personal and intimate.</p>

                        <p>Female friendships depend more on fact-to-fact contact, are more emotional and supportive, and have a component of sharing thoughts and feelings. In contrast, male friendships are more side-to-side, and less emotional and are transactional in nature. Men are more likely to make use of humor to taunt a friend, which they consider to be an innocent activity, whereas women will refrain from such so that they don’t hurt their friend’s feelings. Men also tend to hang out more in a group, while women prefer to hang out on a more individual basis.</p>
                        
                        <p>All of these differences do not apply to all male-male and female-female friendships but it does point out the various ways in which these friendships differ from one another. Friendship become more satisfying and longer-lasting and add to an individual’s psychological wellbeing when they are more intimate in terms of warmth, exchange of social support and self-disclosure (Sanderson, Rahm, & Beigbeder, 2005; Sherman, Lansford, & Volling, 2006). 
                        </p>

                        <p>Other-sex Friendships:</p>
                        <p>These are non-romantic, platonic relationships between individuals of different genders. These relationships often help individuals gain companionship and self-esteem, and they also understand about masculine and feminine styles of intimacy (Bleske & Buss, 2000). For men, these friendships provide them with opportunities to broaden their expressive capacity as they confide easily in their female friendships. For women, male friends offer a more objective lens on various problems and situations, helping them view their difficulties from different points of views (Monsour, 2002). </p>
                            
                        <p>Such friendships do have their own set of pros and cons. The good is that individuals get a diverse perspective on various aspects of life, leading to a more holistic understanding of different viewpoints. Emotional support that you receive from the opposite-sex differs from the same-sex friends. There is also honest communication as parties from the opposite sex may feel more comfortable in discussing specific topics, or seeking opinions and advice, without the fear of judgment, rejection or competition that could exist in the same-sex friendships. The person’s social circle is also expanded by engaging in both same-sex and opposite-sex friendships.</p>
                            
                            
                        <p>However, there are cons to such friendships. There can be a misinterpretation of intentions, and one person can develop romantic feelings for the other, which causes misunderstandings and complications within the friendship. Enforcing clear boundaries becomes essential to avoid any discomfort. Moreover, some societies frown upon close friendships between men and women and assume there to be underlying romantic or sexual intentions.</p>
                            <p>Suffice to say, emerging adults are pretty flexible about people they develop friendships networks with (Barry & Madsen, 2010). There are cases when even after a breakup, a former romantic partner remains a friend.

                    <h3>Sexual Orientation</h3>
                    <p>Sexual orientation is a fundamental feature of human identity that describes an individual's long-term pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attraction to others. It is a multifaceted concept shaped by a variety of biological, psychological, social, and cultural elements. Understanding sexual orientation is crucial since it influences a person's experiences, relationships, and sense of identity.</p>

                    </p>
                    <h3>Sexual Health</h3>
                    <p>There is no universal way of describing what sexual health is as it is a very broad concept. The World Health Organization defines sexual health as “a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Sexual health requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. For sexual health to be attained and maintained, the sexual rights of all persons must be respected, protected and fulfilled.”
                    </p>
                    <p>ASHA defines it as “Sexual health is the ability to embrace and enjoy our sexuality throughout our lives. It is an important part of our physical and emotional health. Being sexually healthy means:
                        Understanding that sexuality is a natural part of life and involves more than sexual behavior.
                        Recognizing and respecting the sexual rights we all share.
                        Having access to sexual health information, education, and care.
                        Making an effort to prevent unintended pregnancies and STIs and seek care and treatment when needed.
                        Being able to experience sexual pleasure, satisfaction, and intimacy when desired.
                        Being able to communicate about sexual health with others including sexual partners and healthcare providers.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given the above definitions, we can conclude that the key components of sexual health is:

                        <h2>Forming Healthy Relationships</h2>
                        <p>Healthy relationships revolve around the concept of mutual respect, open communication, trust, support and effort. There are no imbalances in power, and the people involved in the relationship respect each other’s independence. 
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            <p> An understanding of healthy relaitonships necessitates the understanding of unhealthy relationships. What exactly do we mean by "unhealthy" relationships?
                                Unhealthy relationships exhibit a pattern of behavior characterized by lack of communication, power imbalance, lack of boundaries, kind of abuses, no mutual respect, etc. Typically, one person has more control over the others in such relationships.

                            <h3>Self-Expansion Model</h3>
                            <p>This model was given by Aron and Aron, relating the model to romantic, familial and other close relationships. (Aron & Aron, 1997). There are two fundamental principles when it comes to relationships:</p>
                            <p><i>1. Motivational Principle</i>, which refers to people seeking to expand their potential efficacy through exploration, self-improvement, curiosity, competence, etc. </p>
                            <p>2. Inclusion-of-other-in-the-self Principle, which refers to the ways in which people seek to expand their self through the close relationship as they are faced with the other’s perspectives, identities and resources.</p>
                            <p>Relationships that we engage in play a huge role in shaping our identities and providing us with shared resources. Moreover, we also develop different perspectives from the close relationships that we form. The Self-expansion model states that it is important for people’s sense of self to expand and grow throughout their lives in order for them to feel satisfied with their lives. The motivational principle here is tied to a person’s ability to accomplish their goals. According to research, the concept that the self expands through relationships is literal in sense. People in close relationships elaborate on their self-concepts with a lot more complexity than those who are not in close relationships. People treat their close others as if they are indistinguishable from themselves.</p>
                            <p>Moreover, the model also suggests that people have a tendency to make more situational than dispositional attributions to explain the behavior of close others, which is consistent with how information gets processed about the self. For example, if your best friend is not able to complete an assignment on time, you will have a tendency to consider the situational variables like falling sick, or dealing with problems, rather than looking at dispositional variables like your best friend procrastinating or not being dedicated to her work. </p>
                            <p>The model states that people are motivated to enter relationships to enhance their self and increase their self-efficacy (Aron & Aron, 1986). As has been mentioned above, people seek to expand themselves in the context of including-others-in-the-self. This presents that over time, as the person is engaged in the close relationships, the other’s resources, perspectives and identity gets integrated into one’s own self-concept. </p>
                            <p>Relationships thrive when both partners feel that the close bond allows for personal growth and improvement. When the relationships provide opportunities for self-expansion, through emotional fulfillment or new experiences, then the relationship becomes more satisfying. As such, both persons benefit from this as their capacities, skills, and resources through the partner’s influence is enhanced. Alternatively, when there is no room for personal development, the relationship becomes unsatisfying and causes frustration. As a consequence, the partners may search for new ways to expand themselves, which happens either by renewing the relationships or looking for new relationships. </p>
                            <p>Applications of the Model:</p>
                            <p>1. Romantic Relationships: Individuals show a likelihood to adopt the characteristics of their partner by taking on new interests or roles. This strengthens the bond between the partners, fostering closeness and mutual enjoyment, allowing both to grow together and individually. </p>
                            <p>2. Friendships: Close friends introduce each other to a variety of ideas, experiences and point-of-views, causing personal growth and mutual learning. By engaging in shared activities, the individuals expand their resources and knowledge and form a deep connection with their friends.</p>
                            <p>3. Professional Relationships: The models explain how collaborative efforts are highly successful. Teams that encourage their members to example their sense of sense by learning new skills and leveraging each other’s knowledge and resources, innovation and productivity increases, along with professional capabilities. </p>
                            <p>Criticism of the Model:</p>
                            <p>> Cultural Differences: This model reflects the western culture and ideas of growth, which is not applicable in many of the collectivist cultures as the relationships are focused on group harmony and shared identity rather than individual self-expansion.</p>
                            <p>> Dependency: There can be a tendency for a person to become dependent on the other because the person’s sense of self may become overly reliant on the relationship or the partner. This leads to codependency. </p>
                            <p>> Long-term Relationships: Maintaining self-expansion can become challenging in long-term relationships as the novelty fades and partners need to put in conscious efforts to find new ways to grow together. </p>
                            <p>This model highlights how mutual growth in relationships enhances the emotional bonds between people and contributes to relationship satisfaction, while also making mention of the need for novelty and balance in relationships. Personal growth and identity development is important within relationships. </p>
                            <h3>Boundaries</h3>
                            <p>These are be understood as the rules, limits, or restrictions we set for ourselves in our relationships on the basis of what is acceptable to us. They are the lines we draw for ourself in terms of the degree of comfort around others. </p>
                            <p>There are various types of boundaries:</p>
                            <p>1. Physical: These boundaries are concerned with the comfort level of the individual in terms of physical proximity, physical touch and physical space from others.</p>
                            <p>2. Emotional: These refer to how comfortable an individual is in sharing their emotional experiences. It is put in place to protect our feelings and to ensure our emotional well-being. They help differentiate your feelings from others, and allows to create an emotional safe space for ourselves.</p>
                            <p>3. Mental: These boundaries protect your autonomy in having your own ideas, thoughts, values, beliefs, and opinions and prevents them to be manipulated or pressured by others.</p>
                            <p>4. Sexual: These refer to your right to give consent, to express your sexual needs, and to inquire about your partner’s sexual history before engaging in sexual contact. They also include an individual’s comfort related to the type of sexual touch and intimacy they want with whom they would want this, when, where and how often they would want this.
                            </p>
                            <p>5. Time: These refer to the way in which an individual would want to spend their time. They provide protection from agreeing to spend your time on things you don’t want to. They help in preventing you from over-committing to others.</p>
                            <p>6. Material and Financial: These boundaries helps an individua protect their financial possessions, resources, as well as how you allow others to use your things. You have the right to spend our money how you want, and make use of your items in ways you deem appropriate.
                            </p>
                            <p>7. Relational: These refer to how an individual expects to be  treated in their social relationships, whether it’s personal, romantic or professional. They set limits withing each relationship so that there are elements of mutual respect, understanding, and healthy interactions. </p>

                            <p>
                                Boundaries vary from one person to the other. Since all relationships are different, and no two people are the same, the sets of boundaries that people set look very different from one another. For example, A is a person who is very affectionate and is comfortable with hugs, holding hands, and putting an arm around someone. Physical touch for A is a comfortable space. However, M does not enjoy getting hugs and finds it overwhelming when someone touched them without asking. For M, physical touch with others is not a comfortable space, and as such she has a strict physical boundary. Another example, R is a person who does not mind if someone borrows his clothes, books, or any other item, as long as they’re returned in their proper conditions. He is more relaxed with his material boundary and is comfortable sharing his possessions with others. In contrast, J is not comfortable sharing his belongings and is protective of his personal items. He has a firm material boundary and prefers to keep his things with himself to prevent any loss or damage.

                            <p>Importance of Boundaries:</p>
                            <p>> Ensure that you do not become resentful towards the other person</p>
                            <p>> Enable you to keep your sense of independence intact while still maintaining your relationships</p>
                            <p>> Prevents feeling burnout and overwhelm</p>
                            <p>> Enhance self-awareness and self-respect</p>
                            <p>> Form safe and respectful spaces</p>
                            <p>How to Set Boundaries:</p>
                            <p>> Know what you want in a relationship: In every relationship that you are a part of, it is important for you to reflect on your values and beliefs and understand what you want from the relationships. This can be done by getting to know yourself better, and by assessing how you feel with someone. Some reflections that you can make are to understand what behaviors bother you, what traits do you like to see in other relationships, did the other person do anything to make you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, did you feel overwhelmed by the person’s requests or expectations of you, etc.</p>
                            <p>> Talk to the person about your needs: Effectively communicating your needs to the other person is of utmost importance when establishing boundaries. This can be done by clearly stating your needs, by making use of the “I” statement when conveying how you feel, and by addressing the questions that the other person might have related to your boundaries. </p>
                            <p>> Enforce boundaries: There may come times where people cross your boundaries or may not respect your boundaries. In such cases, making sure that you are firm about your boundary is important. Restating them and having clear and reasonable consequences for boundary crossing will help you enforce your boundaries. </p>

                            <h2>Emerging Trends</h2>
                            <p>Intro</p>
                            <h3>Long distance and Virtual Relationships</h3>
                            <p>With the evolutions of technology it has been increasingly easy to communicate with anyone anywhere and anytime. Aside from simply the ease this affords in regard to communication, it has also opened up many avenues for relationships, romantic and platonic. Some of the opportunities technology has afforded us in the context of relationships are: </p>
                            <p>1. Long Distance relationships</p>
                            <p>There was a time when physical separation meant a possible breakdown of a relationship. There ideally needs to be a bare minimum of communication between two individuals to sustain a relationship. Letters and postcards were exchanged but due to the long wait times between it was a less than ideal form of communication. Modern technology has allowed us to be in instant contact with almost anyone, anywhere, anytime. This has facilitated the development and maintenance of long distance relationships. Being able to seek comfort and solace in your partner or friend despite the distance strengthens and maintains these relationships. </p>
                            <p>2. Virtual relationships</p>
                            <p>With the advent of social media and a myriad of dating apps and websites that facilitate the connection between what can be essentially complete strangers, there is a shift in the way relationships can develop. People are meeting, befriending and even having full blown romantic or platonic relationships with other people without having ever met them in person. The Hyperpersonal Communication Theory implies that online interactions may in fact lead to deeper relationships because all messages can be carefully crafted and thought-out which can lead to heightened feelings of intimacy and self-disclosure. </p>
                            <p>When it comes to these digital means of communication and relationship formation, some ideas are vital to understanding the cause and implications of relationships like these, some of them  are:</p>
                            <p>> Delayed gratification and Commitment: Long distance and virtual relationships often entail and relatively high level of patience and commitment. Partners must be able to delay gratification of desires by postponing physical proximity and other comforts of a regular relationship. This shared struggle can feel more rewarding and worthwhile when the separation finally ends and can lead to strengthen bonds. </p>
                            <p>>Idealization of Partners: There is a popular saying that goes "Distance makes the heart fonder". A major part of this is played by the tendency to idealize or romanticize their partner. Since they spend less time in each other’s company, they tend to focus more on the positive aspects and ignore potential problems. However this can all make things harder when the individuals finally reunite and realize that the person they are with is not the person they thought they were in their head. </p>
                            <p>>Trust and Fidelity: Trust is an important factor in the development and maintenance of long distance and virtual relationships. If these relationships do not have enough trust, open communication, boundary-setting, clear expectations and constant reassurance, they can lead to insecurity, anxiety and jealousy. </p>
                            <h3>Live-in Relationship/Cohabitation</h3>
                            <p>Live-in relationships are those where two individuals who are romantically involved decide to live together. It offers them the many benefits of a married couple without the rigid responsibility and commitment of one. Very often individuals involved in these may jointly own or rent the house/flat, share accounts and expenses and enjoy all the support of their partner due to the close proximity. But there are also drawbacks to this. Let us explore the Pros and Cons of Cohabitation: </p>
                            <p>PROS:</p>
                            <p>To Gauge Compatibility: By living together on a long-term basis, couples can gauge their compatibility and cooperation, kind of like a "Practice Marriage". They can learn whether their lifestyles, habits and ideas are able to fit in together without causing much friction. It can also serve as a basis for the possibility of marriage in the future. </p>
                            <p>Independence and Individual growth: Since there are no legal constraints and implications of marriage in these relationships, there is more scope for independence and focus on Individual growth. Careers can be advanced, they can work on themselves, take time to themselves, etc., all without the societal pressure that comes with marriage. </p>
                            <p>CONS:</p>
                            <p>Social Stigma: Many societies and cultures, specifically Indian culture, will not be accepting of the idea of a live-in relationship. It can be stigmatized by their own family members and society. In cases like these, it is likely that each individual’s opportunities at marriage with someone else in the future are greatly reduced. This can cause estrangement with family or close friends, isolation from loved ones and lead to mental health issues. </p>
                            <p>Reduced Legal Security: Along with the upsides that come with the lack of a legally binding institution like marriage also come the downsides. There is a lack of security for couples in live-in relationships when it comes to things like finances, breakups, taking care of children, etc. This is an especially heavy burden for women in societies like India, who bear a heavier burden from the stigma than men. </p>
                            <h3>Non-monogamy</h3>
                            <p>Types of non-monogamous relationships emerging: </p>
                            <p>1. Open Relationships:</p>
                            <p>This is a kind of relationship dynamic where partners mutually agree to have or pursue sexual and/or romantic connections and relationships outside of their primary partnership. Generally the primary partnership is considered most important and the others are seen as casual flings, but dynamics may vary from person to person. </p>
                            <p>2. Polyamory: </p>
                            <p> This is a kind of relationship dynamic where individuals may form deep sexual and romantic relationships with more than one person, sometimes as a group. Every individual involved is aware and consenting. </p>
                            <p>3. Swinging: </p>
                            <p>This is when a couple consensually engages in casual sexual activities with other couples or individuals. This typically occurs in a group or social setting. Typically it focuses on sexual activities and not on forming emotional or romantic bonds. </p>
                            <p>The main criteria to be met to make non-monogamy safe and ethical is that all parties must be aware and consenting. Failing to meet this basic criteria could lead to a lot of problems like lack of trust, endangered sexual safety, breaking of relationships, etc. </p>
                            <h3>Dual Income No Kids (DINK)</h3>
                            <p>This is an interesting up and coming trend among live-in partners and married couples where both individuals secure steady income and decide against having children. This is a sharp diversion from everything that evolutionary theories have ever explored but can be understood in context of today’s economy.With overpopulation and AI taking over a lot of the available jobs it is hard to run a household without a dual income, not to mention having kids. Both individuals have more freedom and autonomy and can focus on their respective careers and personal development. Despite the growing popularity of this trend in the western Individualistic cultures it is less acceptable and encouraged in Eastern collectivistic cultures, especially India. While in western cultures following this trend and focusing on oneself and one’s life is appreciated and respected, doing the same in India and some other eastern cultures can be considered selfish and irresponsible. The importance of children in carrying on the family lineage is especially sacred and held in high regard in these places. </p>
                            <h3>Singlehood</h3>
                            <p>This is the emerging trend of individuals who consciously decide to be unmarried or to not have a romantic partner. This trend challenges the stereotypes of single people being lonely, unhappy and selfish individuals, proving instead that meaning can be found outside of romantic relationships, in friends and careers and their own personal growth and development. It has also been proven through research that most people who embrace this way of life are equally high on life satisfaction as their married peers. </p>
                            <p>
